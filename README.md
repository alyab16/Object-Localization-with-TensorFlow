# Object-Localization-with-TensorFlow

In this guided project, I am going to use `TensorFlow` to create a model which will be trained to **classify and localize emojis in the input images**. Localization means the position of the emojis in the images.

The model will have **one input** and **two outputs**. Think of this task as a simpler version of object detection.


**Assumption:** I am assuming that there is one object in any given image and our model will classify and localize that object.

This is a practical hands-on guided project for learners who already have theoretical understanding of neural networks, convolutional neural networks and optimization algorithms like gradient descent.
